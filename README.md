# CustomTime

Bukkit/Spigot server plugin to control how fast time moves

**[Download CustomTime for your server](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/customtime)**

### Building from source

1. Make sure you have a recent version of the JDK installed and added to your `PATH` variable.
2. This plugin requires the Spigot API to work, so **[download the jar from here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/spigotmc/spigot-api/)** for your version of Minecraft.
3. Put the Spigot API jar file in this directory (not /src/), and rename it to `spigot-api.jar`.
4. Run `make.bat` or `make.sh`
5. The script should create a `CustomTime.jar` that you can use for your server
